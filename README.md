A lineageos 13 device tree for Samsung Galaxy Core 2. Tested Only on android 6.0.1 r81 (lineageos13), SM-G355H.

**NOTE 1:** This is actually a working reference that supports pretty much everything that needs to be suported (i.e. HW, DualSim, Audio ...) with lesser glitches. I'm particular to the graphics and dual sim card operations.

You won't need the [android\_hardware\_sprd](https://github.com/ih24n69/android\_device\_samsung\_kanas) repo nor the [android\_device\_samsung\_sprd-common](https://github.com/remilia15/android\_hardware\_sprd)

But you would still need the [vendor blobs].
