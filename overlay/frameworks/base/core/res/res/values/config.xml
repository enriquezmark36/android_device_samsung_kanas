    <!-- Device configuration adjusting the minfree tunable in the lowmemorykiller in the
         kernel.  A high value will cause the lowmemorykiller to fire earlier, keeping more
         memory in the file cache and preventing I/O thrashing, but allowing fewer processes
         to stay in memory.  A low value will keep more processes in memory but may cause
         thrashing if set too low.  Directly added to the default value chosen by
         ActivityManager based on screen size and total memory for the largest lowmemorykiller
         bucket, and scaled proportionally to the smaller buckets. 0 keeps the default.
         Below will adjust 6 minfree buckets (in MB) to: 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100 -->
