Subject: [PATCH] DO NOT MERGE healthd: Scan unknown types; read current_now
 before current_max

This change is exclusive for SM-G355**, primarily for SM-G355H.

The more appropiate fix to the wrong current and unknown types
is to patch the kernel itself which may not be always possible.
This patch exists as an alternative to that kernel change.

For some reason, all the current measurement is located at
'sec-charger' with type UNKNOWN and the current limit
are located in current_now rather than current_max.
current measurements are also in milli Amperes rather than
micro Amperes

Hack healthd to include UNKNOWN types and read from
current_now rather than current_max converting units when needed.
