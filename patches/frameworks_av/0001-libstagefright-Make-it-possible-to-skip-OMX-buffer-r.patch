Subject: [PATCH] libstagefright: Make it possible to skip OMX buffer
 reallocation

Some devices don't like the call to setParameter() at this point, so
skip this call if enough buffers are already allocated. This check
was present in KitKat but got removed when code to allocate extra-
buffers was introduced.

This is activated only for omap4 for now.

[This ports the patch to the new Soong build system except for the omap4 thing]
This added check can be used by setting BOARD_CANT_REALLOCATE_OMX_BUFFERS to true
on your BoardConfig.mk.

Since this is soong, there should be a complement patch
on the vendor/lineage directory.
